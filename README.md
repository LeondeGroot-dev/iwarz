Things that should be improved
- MySQL: Bases have a userId and a team. Team is not necessary; it can be read from the user (userId)
- When registering: side color should be presented in a random order to new players
- "Teams" should be "sides"

Functionality that should be added
- 'Attacking players' with tanks and/or airplanes should be written
- When your side is dominating an area, you can build bases there and get more resources
